Description
-----------

Provides a "Limit Text Format" widget for the formatted text fields.
With this widget you can choose the text formats that are available per field.
When none are selected it will fallback to the default format. It will also
check the users access to the text format.

With this widget you can make sure a certain formatted text field is bound to a certain text format
so users can never input in another format.

With composer:
1. ```composer require gertvdb/limit_text_format```
